# intelligentCompass

This is an intelligent compass. Instead to point to north it shows the way and the distance to your coordinate.
To change the coordinate look at the code and change the two floats Lat and Long.

``````````````Arduino
float LAT = 52.344977;    // thats the destination coordinates
float LONG = 17.647720;
`````````````````````
